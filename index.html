          <p class="text-center title pb-1.5"> History of the Devotion to the Sacred Heart</p>

          <p class="text-justify px-3 pb-3">
            The devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus has its roots in early Christian mysticism, particularly in the
            visions
            of
            Saint Gertrude the Great in the 13th century and Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque in the 17th century. However,
            it was
            Saint
            Margaret Mary's visions that significantly shaped the modern devotion.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify px-3 pb-3">
            In 1673-1675, Saint Margaret Mary reported visions of Jesus Christ, in which he revealed his Sacred Heart,
            symbolizing
            his divine love for humanity. She shared these experiences with her confessor, Saint Claude de la
            Colombière. The
            devotion gained momentum, and in 1765, Pope Clement XIII approved the Feast of the Sacred Heart.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify px-3 pb-3">
            The devotion emphasizes Jesus' love, compassion, and sacrifice. It encourages trust, devotion, and
            reparation to
            his
            Sacred Heart, often depicted in art as a heart surrounded by thorns and flames. The feast day is celebrated
            on the
            Friday after the Corpus Christi octave.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify px-3 pb-3">

            Throughout history, numerous saints, popes, and devotees have promoted the devotion, which has become a
            cornerstone of
            Catholic spirituality, focusing on the transformative power of Jesus' love.

1. Come, Holy Ghost, Creator, come
From Thy bright heav’nly throne,
Come, take possession of our souls,
And make them all Thine own.

2. Thou who art called the Paraclete,
Best gift of God above,
The living spring, the living fire,
Sweet unction and true love.

Finger of God’s right hand;

To speak and understand.

4. O guide our minds with Thy blest light,
With love our hearts inflame;
And with Thy strength, which ne’er decays,
Confirm our mortal frame.

5. Far from us drive our deadly foe;
True peace unto us bring;
And through all perils lead us safe
Beneath Thy sacred wing.

6. Through Thee may we the Father know,
Through Thee th’eternal Son,
And Thee the Spirit of them both,
Thrice-blessèd Three in One.

7. All glory to the Father be,
With His co-equal Son:

While endless ages run

Leader:-Prayer to the sacred heart at the beginning of the Adoration</p>
All: -
Behold me, once again prostrate at your feet. O Divine Savior, as a faithful adorer of your Sacred Heart, and as a
consoling friend who comes to make reparation for the outrages which this Heart Incessantly receives. At last the
precious moment has arrived when, according to your desire, I am nearer Thee. I know that you are ready to welcome me
and to listen to me. Your own voice has called me. My heart was longing to hear this call; and though I know my
unworthiness, docile to your summons, I come without fear. And yet who am I, O my God, that I should fulfill on earth
the sublime office of the angels and saints to adore you, saying with them from the depths of my heart: “Holy Holy Holy
is the heart of Jesus”. I adore you, heart of Jesus, united substantially with the word of God. I love you, heart of
Jesus, and symbol of my Saviour’s love for me. I honour you, heart of Jesus, the most beautiful, the best, and the
sweetest of all hearts. I dedicate myself to adore, love and honour you during all my life here on earth, so that I may
glorify you throughout eternity.
Who am I, O my divine savour that I should dare to make reparation to you; that I should ask you to accept me as your
victim. Even though I surrender myself forever to you and concentrate myself to you unreservedly to your service, is my
homage of reparation pleasing to you? I have so many personal amends to make! Will not my own sins be a hindrance to
your divine mercy? Behold me prostrate in your present with sentiments of deep humility and loving compassion. Look upon
me with tenderness from your sanctuary where you dost open your heart to me. Forgive my unworthiness, Divine Jesus and
grant me that grace to spend this hour in a manner pleasing to you, so that your heart may be consoled and may receive
reparation for the forgetfulness and coldness of those who abandon you, and for the profanation of those who outrage you
even in the very sacrament of your love. The thought of their outrages fill my soul with horror, while the remembrance
of my own sins overwhelms me with grief. Pardon, O lord, pardon my infidelities and those of all poor sinners. I
acknowledge you as the God of my heart. May I never forget you; may I never insult you again. Would that I could, even
at the cost of my life, repair and make you forget so much ingratitude! O dearest Jesus enlighten the blind who slight
you, and convert sinners who abuse your benefits and wound your most sacred heart. Accept as a token of reparation my
avowal, my sorrow, my gratitude and my promises. Avowal of my sins which I detest, sorrow for the outrages which grieve
you; gratitude for your merciful kindness, finally the desire, the will, and the sincere resolution to make reparation
by adoring you perpetually upon earth, so that I may adore you forever in heaven where I shall love you without fear of
losing you, O God of my heart. Amen. May the sacred heart of Jesus be loved, praised, blessed and adored forever and
ever! Amen.

Leader:-Act of reparation to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament</p>
Divine Savour, who by an incompressible effect of your love towards men, dost dwell in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the
alter and who, instead of the respect and adoration which ought to be rendered you, receive too often butt indifference,
contempt, and outrages, I cast myself before you here present in the Holy Eucharist, in order to make reparation for all
that you dost suffer incessantly in this adorable Sacrament. I desire first of all, to make reparation for all the
irreverence’s which I myself have committed in your presence; for the scandal which I have given: for my want of desire
to approach your Holy Table and to assist at Holy Mass; for my lack of devotion in receiving you and in attending the
Holy Sacrifice; for the little fruit which I have drawn from these inestimable sources of grace; for the sacrileges
which I may have committed; and lastly for all the outrages of which I may have guilty or in which I may have taken any
part. I desire also to make reparation for all the insults heaped upon you in this august sacrament since its
institution; for the irreverence you dost suffer every day throughout the world; and finally for all the injuries,
affronts and persecution of which you have always been the object in the sacrament of your love. Prostrate before you, I
most humbly crave your pardon. I acknowledge that you are worthy of all honour. All praise and all glory. You are the
king of heaven and earth, though hidden under the Eucharist veil and, as such I offer you the most reverential and
loving reparation. I concentrate myself wholly to you; I place myself in spirit and in desire before all the tabernacles
of the world in which you dost dwell sacramentally. There to render you all glory. I unite my homage to that which you
have received and will receive from all your creatures, throughout times and eternity. To the lamb that was immolated
for us: power, divinity, wisdom, strength, honour, glory and benediction forever and evere! Amen

O Jesus, infinite love, I wish to consecrate myself to you with all the fervor of my soul. I offer you my entire being
on the altar of your heart, where you dost sacrifice yourself through love me. I offer you my body which I will respect
as the temple wherein you dwell; my soul which I will tend as a garden where you will come to take your repose, my sense
which I will guard because they are the doors through which temptation may enter; the powers of my soul which I will
open to the inspiration of your grace; my thoughts which shall no longer be attached to the illusions of the world; my
desires which shall tend towards the happiness of heaven; my virtues to flourish under the shade of your protection; my
passions which I will submit to the yoke of your commandment, even my sins which I will detest as long as my heart is
capable of hatred and for which I will weep until the source of my tears fails. From to-day my heart desires to be
entirely yours for ever, as you, O divine Heart, had wished to be mine; may it be forever yours without fault tepidity.
I will serve you for those who offend you; I will love you for those who hate you; I will pray and sacrifice myself for
all who blaspheme you. Do you, who search the depths of heart and who know the sincerity of my desires, grant me the
grace which I gives an all- powerful strength to weak, give me the victory in the battle of life, that one day you may
crown me with an immortal crown in the dwelling place of your glory. May you be rewarded, and Your sacred Heart my
eternal Paradise. Your Kingdom Come!

Leader:-PRAYER FOR VOCATIONS</p>
Most Sacred heart of Jesus, through the Immaculate Heart of Your Mother, send forth the light of Your grace to enlighten
my mind to know your will in regard to my state in life Give me courage to live and die ever striving to advance Your
reign as King in every home and in all the world. Dear Jesus, zealous apostles of your Sacred Heart are needed. The
field is already ripe for the harvest of souls. Send laborers into the vineyard, and if it be Your will that apostles be
drawn from among Your Night Adorers, grant that we may be awake to your call: “ come, follow Me”, and become, in spirit
and in truth, perpetual adorers of Your Sacred Heart. Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, Your Kingdom come in me and through
me. Amen! (Nobert McCarthy, SS.CC.)

Leader:-EFFICACIOUS PRAYER TO THE SACRED HEART</p>
O Divine Jesus, Who has said:” Ask, and you shall receive: seek and you shall find; Knock, and it shall be opened unto
you, “behold us prostrate at your feet. Animated with a lively faith and confidence in those promises, dictated by your
sacred Heart and pronounced by your adorable lips. I come to ask (Here mention your request). From whom shall I ask, O
sweet Jesus, if not from you Whose Heart is inexhaustible source of all grace and merit? Where shall I SEEK if not in
the treasure which contains all the riches of your clemency and bounty? Where shall I KNOCK, if it be not at the door of
your sacred Heart, through which God himself comes us and through which we go to God? To you then O Heart of Jesus, I
have recourse. In you I find consolation when afflicted, protection when prosecuted, strength when overwhelmed with
trials, and light in doubt and darkness. I firmly believe you can bestow upon me the grace I implore, even though it
should require a miracle, you are only to will it and my prayers is granted, I know I am most unworthy of Your Favors, o
Jesus! But this is not reason for me to be discouraged. You are the God of mercies and you will not refuse a contrite
and humble heart. Cast upon me a look of pity, I implore you, and your compassionate Heart will find in my miseries and
weakness a pressing motive for granting my petition. But O Sacred Heart, whatever may be your decision with regard to my
request, I will never cease to adore, love, praise and serve you. Deign my Jesus, to accept this act of perfect
submission to the decrees of your Adorable Heart, which I sincerely desire may be fulfilled in and by me and all your
creatures forever and ever (Amen).

Leader:-PRAYERS TO THE SACRED HEART</p>
Dear Sacred Heart of Jesus, I have asked you for many favors, nut I beg for this one (here mention the intention). Take
it, place it in your Open-broken Heart, and when the external Father sees it, covered with the mantle of your most
precious blood, He cannot refuse it, for then it is your prayer, not mine.

Almighty and Eternity God, Father of all nations and people, look down, we beseech you, in your bountiful mercy, your
people of Nigeria, who now take our place among the nation of the world, that our political freedom may, by your
blessing, be an instrument whereby we may live more worthily, in accordance with the liberty of the children of God.

Inflame our heart in supernatural charity, which will overcome dissensions, rivalries and resentment of tribe and
province, and draw all together into a union of true brotherhood, which by your grace will bring about that all may be
one in you our Common Father. Bless our nation that it may in harmony with other nations. Enlighten and guide our rulers
so that they may worthily fulfill their mission, by helping all the citizens to achieve earthly well-being, and by

Leader:-CLOSING PRAYER TO THE BLESSED SACRAMENT</p>
All: As this hour of adoration closes, O Jesus* I renew my faith and trust in You* I am refreshed after these moments
with You* and I count myself among a privileged number,* even as Your disciples were,* who shared Your actual presence*
Realizing that my visit to You is of little avail* unless I try to live better life and set a better example,* I am
resolved to go forth again to my duties and my concerns* with a renewed spirit of perseverance and good will,* in my
daily life I will try to love and serve God well,* and love my neighbor also*, for these two things go together. * I
will try to be a true disciple, indeed. Help me, O Jesus,* in this my resolution.

Bless me dear lord before I go, and bless not me alone, O Lord, but all as well as who are here present, and all who
could not come, especially the sick and the dying. Bless our homes and all the children there. Bless all our life and
the hour of our death. Grant rest to the souls of the faithful departed, and bring them into the light of your divine
glory. So may we who have worshipped you and been blessed by you here on earth come to behold the radiant glory of your
unveiling countenance in heaven for ever and ever. Amen. Sacred heart of Jesus, *your kingdom come (3 times).
